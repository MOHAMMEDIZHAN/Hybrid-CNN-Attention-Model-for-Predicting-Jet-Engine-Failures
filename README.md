# Hybrid-CNN-Attention-Model-for-Predicting-Jet-Engine-Failures
Built a CNN-based RUL prediction system for aircraft engines using NASAâ€™s CMAPSS dataset. Developed a hybrid 1D CNN with temporal attention and asymmetric loss, improving accuracy by 80% RMSE and reducing late predictions by 35% through EDA-based feature selection and adaptive normalization.
